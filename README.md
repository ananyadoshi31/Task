The project is a Create React App-based user directory that fetches user data from jsonplaceholder.typicode.com using Axios, with proper loading and error handling. It displays users in a searchable and sortable list, supporting live filtering by name or email and client-side sorting in ascending or descending order. When a user is clicked, detailed information including email, phone, company, and address is shown in the UserDetails component, which smoothly scrolls into view. The Users and UserDetails components manage the list items and selected userâ€™s details, while the main App component handles the overall state.
